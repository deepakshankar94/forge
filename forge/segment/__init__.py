"""Episode segmentation via PELT changepoint detection.

Detects phase transitions in proprioception signals to split episodes
into meaningful segments (sub-skills, regime changes).

Usage::

    from forge.segment import SegmentAnalyzer

    analyzer = SegmentAnalyzer(penalty="bic", cost_model="rbf")
    report = analyzer.segment_dataset("./bridge_v2")
    report.to_json("segments.json")
